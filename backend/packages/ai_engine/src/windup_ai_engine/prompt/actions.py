"""待机 / 攻击 i2v 提示词。

措辞迁自 windup-pipeline 已验证的 prompt_library(idle / slash),按本模块的 facing 分流改写。

- **idle**:循环类(tail_match)。只写躯干呼吸节律,武器与双脚显式锁定 —— 逐帧生成待机
  只会抖不会呼吸,故走 i2v 或程序化 Idle-B。
- **attack**:一次性类。四条已验证的锁定:①"one single committed motion"防复读;
  ②剑长与握点固定;③剑在身前、刃面朝观者(防 Z 轴穿模与刀刃翻转);④终态回戒备并保持。
  节奏(蓄力慢/挥砍快/触点定格)在抽帧做,不写进 prompt。
